# Mobile Phone Price Prediction

This machine learning project predicts the price range of mobile phones based on technical specifications such as RAM, battery capacity, camera quality and more. A Random Forest Classifier is used to classify mobile phones into one of four price categories.


## Dataset

mobile_phone_pricing.zip - contains dataset.csv 

Target variable: price_range (0 = Low Cost, 1 = Medium Cost, 2 = High Cost, 3 = Very High Cost)


## Workflow

- Preprocessing: Standardized features using StandardScaler and removed duplicate records.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Correlation heatmap visualized top feature relationships.
- Model Training: Splits data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Trains a RandomForestClassifier model on scaled training data.
- Evaluation: Evaluates model accuracy, confusion matrix and classification report on test data. Saves the trained model and scaler as .pkl files
- Feature Importance Visualization: Plots the top 10 features contributing most to the modelâ€™s decisions.
